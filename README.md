The project folder structure is already set as this repo was forked from an existing webapp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPIuGIAD4hY). 
There is no need for /database and /docs folder. What we have is the /client and /server folder for the frontend and backend+databaselink. Nothwithstanding, a readme has been created. 

Project goal: 
To create a data-driven, secure, accessible and scalable webapp for tenants and property managers to better screen potential tenants based on their rental history and some basic information. 
A one page website that searches, adds, deletes tenant information is an MVP we can work towards. A first step in the project would be mastering the ins and out of this forked repo.

Connection to SQL and database: 
The server.js in the server folder is the connection between the backend and the database. For now, the functions just need to be edited to suit our needs.
